/*
 * PID speed controller for the drive motor.
 *
 * The motor was previously driven at a fixed duty cycle (MOTOR_DUTY_FWD = 35),
 * which assumed the car always travels at exactly MOTOR_SPEED_MM_S = 346 mm/s.
 * In reality, speed varies with battery level, surface friction, and load.
 * This error propagates directly into dead_reckon_pose() — if the assumed speed
 * is wrong, the estimated position drifts from the real one every cycle.
 *
 * The PID closes the loop: it reads the actual speed from the AS5600 encoder
 * via imu_encoder_driver_get_speed_ms(), compares it to the target, and adjusts
 * the PWM duty cycle to keep the real speed close to the commanded value.
