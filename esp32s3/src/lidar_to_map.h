/* ── LiDAR extrinsic calibration (sensor origin relative to robot centre) ─── *
 *                                                                              *
 * *** CALIBRATION REQUIRED — all three values are currently zero ***          *

 * If the LiDAR is NOT mounted exactly above the robot's centre of rotation,   *
 * the map will be smeared: walls appear at different positions depending on    *
 * the robot heading, making them look "fat" or duplicated.                     *
 *                                                                              *
 * How to measure:                                                              *
 *   1. Place the robot against a flat wall and drive a known straight path.    *
 *   2. Check the dashboard: the wall should be a single straight line.         *
 *      If it curves or is thick, adjust X_MM (forward offset of sensor).       *
 *   3. Rotate the robot in place in front of a wall, watch the map.            *
 *      If the wall sweeps in an arc, the LIDAR is offset laterally — adjust    *
 *      Y_MM (port/starboard offset) until the wall stays stationary.           *
 *   4. If the entire map is rotated relative to the robot heading, adjust       *
 *      THETA_RAD (sensor yaw). One degree = 0.01745 rad.                       *
 *                                                                              *
 * Sign conventions:                                                            *
 *   X_MM > 0   : sensor is forward  of the rear-axle centre                   *
 *   Y_MM > 0   : sensor is to port  (left when facing forward)                 *
 *   THETA_RAD  : sensor yaw relative to robot forward axis (CCW positive)      */

 * if the last miss and the HIT land in the same 156 mm quadtree leaf the
 * 30:1 HIT:MISS ratio (net +29) keeps the cell firmly occupied.
 * Setting guard > 0 creates an unknown band of that width along every wall
 * face, which the frontier detector misreads as unexplored space.
